Hi there! I am Dayu Xia (夏大雨), majoring in Mechanical Engineering @ [ZJUI, Zhejiang University](https://zjui.intl.zju.edu.cn/en) and [Dept. of MechSE, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://mechse.illinois.edu/) (UIUC) (dual degree program).

About me
======
As an ME student, my interests lie at the intersection of control science and machine learning. I'm also pursuing a minor in mathematics @ UIUC. Starting at the summer of 2024, I have the fortune to work with [Prof. Dušan M. Stipanović](https://ise.illinois.edu/directory/profile/dusan) from [CSL, U of I](https://csl.illinois.edu/) on applying modified internal model control on RNN and Transformer architecture to boost robustness and trustability. Later on during my exchange time at UIUC, I also worked closely with Dr. Srikar Annamraju and Harris Nisar on a robotic trail maker system facilitating upper-limb rehabilitation. In April 2025, we wrapped up our work: ["Robotic Trail Maker Platform for Rehabilitation in Neurological Conditions: Clinical Use Cases"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.19230). Feel free to check it out!

I have solid mathematics background with profound familiarity with programming languages such as Python and C, CAD softwares like Solidworks and Fusion 360. Now I am actively looking for M.S. or Ph.D. position in robotics of 2026 Fall. You are more than welcome to check out my [CV](https://dyxia1241.github.io/files/CV_new.pdf) for more details.
